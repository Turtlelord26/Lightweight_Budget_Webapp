# Lightweight_Budget_Webapp
This stateless application allows the input of a numeric total and various allocations for moneys from that total. 
On any change to the input fields it calculates the difference between the sum of the allocations and the input total and displays that difference in the 'Unallocated' field. 
Users may also define custom, case-sensitive categories via the add/remove button, and may remove both their custom categories and the baseline ones (except for the Total Allocation and Unallocated items).
